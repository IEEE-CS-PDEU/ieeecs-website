# IEEE Club Website - PDEU

Welcome to the IEEE Club Website project for PDEU! This project is built using [Astro](https://astro.build), a modern web framework designed for performance and flexibility.

## üåü Why Astro?
Astro is a lightweight web framework optimized for performance and modern web development. It allows for:
- **Fast Loading Speeds**: Generates static HTML by default for optimal performance.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Supports multiple UI frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
- **Minimal JavaScript by Default**: Reduces page load times.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Generates highly optimized web pages.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and better code maintainability.

We are using **TypeScript** in this project for better maintainability and scalability.

## üìñ Learning Astro
To learn more about Astro, check out the official documentation:
- [Astro Documentation](https://docs.astro.build/)

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (preferred) or npm/yarn
- Git (for version control)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IEEE-CS-PDEU/ieeecs-website.git
   cd ieeecs-website
   ```
2. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:
   ```sh
   # Using pnpm (preferred)
   pnpm install
   
   # Using npm

   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server
To start the local development server:
```sh
# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev
```
This will start the Astro dev server, usually at `http://localhost:4321` (check terminal output for exact URL).

### Building for Production
